# Hybrid TimeMAE & MeshMAE for Anomaly Detection

**Description**  
Hybrid framework combining TimeMAE and MeshMAE for anomaly detection in time-series and 3D mesh data. ⚠️ Work in progress.

## Features
- Temporal anomaly detection using **TimeMAE**.
- Geometric/mesh anomaly detection using **MeshMAE**.
- Integrates spatial and temporal reconstruction errors for robust anomaly scoring.

## Status
- Code, models, and experiments are still under development.
- Data processing and training pipelines are being implemented.
- Mapping anomalies onto the 3D model is currently a work in progress.
